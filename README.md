Overview:

This project is the base foundation of Co-Lab, a website for students to study together virtually. Co-Lab uses the classes and university provided
by the user in order to get paired with another user who has similar courses, so they can study the material together. The web application will support
a multitude of tools, such as: webcam support, screen share, and calculators! 

Benefits of Co-Lab:

Studies have shown that around 64% of college students have reported feeling "very lonely", this problem was only made worse by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Co-Lab will help alleviate the stress of finding study-buddies, all through a simple web application.
